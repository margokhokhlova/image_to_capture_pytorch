# image_to_capture_pytorch
My version of the cn231 model IMAGE2Capture re-coded using the PyTorch library

This is an attempt to learn some more pytorch by re-implementing the model from scratch.
Some functions provided by the cs231n course were used, and all the dataloaders.
The model generates random text so far,  so I am planning to improve on that.
The code here is stored only as a semo for myself, I hardly recommend to use it :)
